## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, "The Snail Farm" website.

Hopefully this project will show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I aim to create an interactive website based on what I have learned from the course.

My inspiration for this project comes from my interests on snail farming, and having adventure in the farm at the same time.

I am a fan of minimalism which I applied on my project because I believe that less is more.

Below is an outline and the steps taken behind the project.

Thank you for viewing this project.

## **UXD â€“ User Experience Design**

The goal of my project should provide a positive emotional experience for the user. The reality as developers is that it can be easy to implement features, which is good, but forgetting what matters most is for the users to interact easily with the project.

The project has 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## **Strategy Plane**

The Strategy Plane consists of an idea to help us to better understand the goals of the project. I created 2 stories which are "developer stories and user stories".

### **Developer Stories** ###

- As a developer, I want to use images which are earth colors to not to exaggerate the projects contrast and to response a positive emotional.

- As a developer, I would like a simple typography in the project which is comfortable to look at and is  easy to read.

- As a developer, I want the project to be responsive.

### **User Stories** ###

- As a user, I want the landing page to help me understand what is the project all about.

- As a user, I should be able to navigate to the relevant pages and social links that will give me complex Information about the product.

- As a user, I want to be able to see the different locations of the farm through a map.

- As a user, I would like to see a responsive contact form to get in touch through email and inquire about the product.

- Most of the time im on my mobile so as a user I want to research online using my mobile phone.

## **Scope Plane**

My issue creating this project with the goals I had was the timeframe fixing issues and bugs with the lack of experience using JavaScript. So I have decided to start with a minimal viable product (MVP). So here is my plan to reach my goal for an effective website.

**Page 1**
- A home page, with a navigation menu at the center top.
- A logo on top left with a quote describing the project and linked into home page when clicked.
- Slide images on the landing page that explains the whole context of the project. 
- Social links button at the bottom of the page so that the user can explore more about the product.

**Page 2**

- Navigation menu, logo, and social links are in this page as well.
- About us page which tells a short story of the founder of the company.

**Page 3** 

- Navigation menu, logo, and social links are in this page too.
- Things to do page which includes images and text of different activities.
- A map with different locations of the farm.
- Different cities when being clicked, it will zoom the area.

**Page 4** 

- It is a contact section which has the same logo, navigation menu an social links.
- Contact details of the company is on the left side.  
- On the right side is a contact form where the user can fill it up. There are input boxes for name, email address 
and type message.

## **Structure Plane**

**Colors**

I have decided to use earth colors background image which i find it simple yet classy which will match the text colors. The text colors i simply used black and white fro its simple and clean look. 

I have always been one who prefers minimalism look which I find more catchy and focused on the purpose of the project in every aspects.

**Typography**

I chose Heebo and Lobster, cursive for this project. 
Lobster, cursive for the logo which I find it nice. Heebo for the general text. I find it modern, easy on the eyes, and readable. 
It wont distract the user and it won't exxagerate the website.

## **Skeleton Plane**

Below are the screenshots of wireframes.

For this project, I used balsamiq for its convenience.

## **Surface Plane**

- The home page has a navigation menu. It link to the relevant pages.
- The Navbar changes to a hamburger menu when its on mobile and Ipad devices.
- Large hero image to draw the users attention. It keeps the attention of the user consisted and interested on th
- Earth colors background for its simplicity yet eye catching to target the users emotion and it won't distract users when its too colorful.
- Different images that explains the whole context of the product. 
- Contact form to get in touch and inquire with the company.

## **Testing**

[User Story testing](/workspace/the-snail-story/assets/images/mix-img/testing.pdf)

**Further Testing**

The project was deployed early to gather feedback throughout developement and find bugs, I used Chrome Dev Tools to help test responsiveness.
Chrome Dev Tools used to emulate the following devices,
- Apple Ipad
- Apple Ipad Pro
- Microsoft Surface Duo
- Motorola G4
- Samsung Galaxy S5
- Google Pixel 2/2 XL
- Apple iPhone 5/SE
- Apple iPhone 6/7/8
- Apple iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- Apple iPhone XL

The project was manually tested on the Iphone 11 and Samsung A70.

The project was tested on the following browsers,
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera

I used the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator to validate my HTML and CSS. All errors were corrected.

I used JSHint to check my JavaScript code, All errors were corrected. 
- One warning which may show on the quiz-end.js page is due to the function relating to the save button is called in the quiz-end.html file.

Due to time constraints and a lack of experience, I was unable to effectively unit test my JavaScript. My workaround to this was to simply try a trial and error method to test whether my functions correctly worked.
I used some tutorial videos to give me an idea of the functions that would be required and to understand the logic. 

I have to formally apologize if the JavaScript code may look like spaghetti, but my first attempt at trying a more object-orientated approach did not net the results I expected. This again is more due to a lack of experience and understanding of JavaScript. 

I started all my Javascript files with a process in mind, 
- Create Variables for the HTML elements.
- Write functions relating to the intracting elements.

My method for testing my functions was simple process of trial and error. I tried to write my functions, save and check the results. If the desired result did not come about my process was,
- Check Chrome dev tools for any errors in the console. 
    - Finding errors in the console was the easiest starting point. It gave me a clear indication of where the errors was. 
- If the Dev Tools console gave no error, and the functions still did not work, I re-checked the function. 
- At this point I normally would look for advice, fortunately I had some friends who were able to aid me by pointing me in the direction of why the functions were not providing the desired results.

This method worked for a simple project like this, but something I would definately like to try is to attempt some unit testing with JavaScript in the future.

**Known Bugs and Fixes**

- JShint Code parsing.
    - My first time parsing my code through JShint came with many errors. Many of these errors were corrected with the use of ``/*jshint esversion: 6 */``. 
    - I also had errors relating to functions and variables not being defined and missing semi-colons, these errors were correct with the use of ``let`` and adding the ``;`.
    - Credit to these fixes goes to, Aaron Sinnot, my mentor and Kotaro TANAKA, from Slack.
- Error 404 when clicking the save button, to save score.
    - I wasn't having the issue in my IDE because during development, but Users were getting directed to a non existing page when clicking save. 
    - I fixed the function relating to the save button by adding ``window.location.assign(`https://harry-leepz.github.io/StarWars-Quizapp/quiz-end.html`);`` to redirect back to the same page when Users click save.
- Users were having to click the text in the quiz page, clicking anywhere except for the text would not trigger the event listner function. 
    - Gave the CSS class for the answer content ``width: 100%;`` to make it the same width as the parent element.

Alot of the Issues I encountered during development was due to my lack of expereince working with JavaScript. I made the mistake of using camelcase when naming variables, but not using camel case when referring to them in functions which caused some issues. 
Also I made the mistake of using the ability to highlight and "Change all occurences" options of Gitpod, which caused some issue during development.
