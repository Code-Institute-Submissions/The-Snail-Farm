## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, "The Snail Farm" website.

Hopefully this project will show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I aim to create an interactive website based on what I have learned from the course.

My inspiration for this project comes from my interests on snail farming, and having adventure in the farm at the same time.

I am a fan of minimalism which I applied on my project because I believe that less is more.

Below is an outline and the steps taken behind the project.

Thank you for viewing this project.

## **UXD â€“ User Experience Design**

The goal of my project should provide a positive emotional experience for the user. The reality as developers is that it can be easy to implement features, which is good, but forgetting what matters most is for the users to interact easily with the project.

The project has 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## **Strategy Plane**

The Strategy Plane consists of an idea to help us to better understand the goals of the project. I created 2 stories which are "developer stories and user stories".

### **Developer Stories** ###

- As a developer, I want to use images which are earth colors to not to exaggerate the projects contrast and to response a positive emotional.

- As a developer, I would like a simple typography in the project which is comfortable to look at and is  easy to read.

- As a developer, I want the project to be responsive.

### **User Stories** ###

- As a user, I want the landing page to help me understand the purpose of the project.

- As a user, I should be able to navigate to the relevant pages that will give me Information about the product.

- As a user, I want to be able to see the different locations of the farm with a map.

- As a user, I would like to see a responsive contact form to get in touch and inquire about the product.

- Most of the time im on my mobile so as a user I want to research online using my mobile phone.

## **Scope Plane**

My issue creating this project with the goals I had was the timeframe fixing issues and bugs with the lack of experience using JavaScript. So I have decided to start with a minimal viable product (MVP). So here is my plan to reach my goal for an effective website.

**Page 1**
- A home page, with a navigation menu at the center top.
- A logo on top left with a quote describing the project and linked into home page when clicked.
- Slide images on the landing page that explains the whole context of the project. 
- Social links button at the bottom of the page so that the user can explore more about the product.

**Page 2**

- Navigation menu, logo, and social links are in this page as well.
- About us page which tells a short story of the founder of the company.

**Page 3** 

- Navigation menu, logo, and social links are in this page too.
- Things to do page which includes images and text of different activities.
- A map with different locations of the farm.
- Different cities when being clicked, it will zoom the area.

**Page 4** 

- It is a contact section which has the same logo, navigation menu an social links.
- Contact details of the company is on the left side.  
- On the right side is a contact form where the user can fill it up. There are input boxes for name, email address 
and type message.

## **Structure Plane**

**Colors**

I have decided to use earth colors background image which i find it simple yet classy which will match the text colors. The text colors i simply used black and white fro its simple and clean look. 

I have always been one who prefers minimalism look which I find more catchy and focused on the purpose of the project in every aspects.

**Typography**

I chose Heebo and Lobster, cursive for this project. 
Lobster, cursive for the logo which I find it nice. Heebo for the general text. I find it modern, easy on the eyes, and readable. 
It wont distract the user and it won't exxagerate the website.
