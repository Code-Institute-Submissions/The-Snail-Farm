## **Introduction**

Welcome to my second milestone project, "The Snail Farm" website.

Hopefully this project will show some fundamental learning and understanding of JavaScript with the combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I aim to create an interactive website based on what I have learned from the course.

My inspiration for this project comes from my interests on snail farming, and having adventure in the farm at the same time.

I am a fan of minimalism which I applied on my project because I believe that less is more.

Below is an outline and the steps taken behind the project.

Thank you for viewing this project.

## **UXD â€“ User Experience Design**

The goal of my project should provide a positive emotional experience for the user. The reality as developers is that it can be easy to implement features, which is good, but forgetting what matters most is for the users to interact easily with the project.

The project has 5 planes,
- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

- As a developer, I want the project to be responsive.

### **User Stories** ###

- As a user, I want the landing page to help me understand the purpose of the project.

- As a user, I should be able to navigate to the relevant pages that will give me Information about the product.

- As a user, I want to be able to see the different locations of the farm with a map.

- As a user, I would like to see a responsive contact form to get in touch and inquire about the product.

- As a user, I want

## **Scope Plane**

My issue creating this project with the goals I had was the timeframe fixing issues and bugs with the lack of experience using JavaScript. So I have decided to start with a minimal viable product (MVP). So here is my plan to reach my goal for an effective website.
